# Dart Reduce() Method Error on Empty Lists

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the `reduce()` method in Dart with empty lists. The `reduce()` method requires at least one element in the list to perform the reduction operation. Attempting to use it on an empty list results in an error.

The `bug.dart` file shows the error scenario. The `bugSolution.dart` file provides a solution using error handling techniques.
